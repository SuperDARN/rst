The SuperDARN Radar Software Toolkit (RST) was developed at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHUAPL), with R.J. Barnes and K.B. Baker as the main authors of the codebase. The RST codebase was adapted from earlier software called RADOPS (RADar OPerating System), which was also developed at JHUAPL.

The original RST package is credited to:

- D. Andre
- K.B. Baker
- R.J. Barnes
- R.A. Greenwald
- C. Hanuise
- N. Mattin
- K. Oksavik
- J.M. Ruohoniemi
- J.P. Villain
- S. Wing

The RST is now maintained collaboratively by the SuperDARN Data Analysis Working Group (DAWG). Members of the international SuperDARN community have contributed to the RST by adding new features, writing documentation, improving modularity, refactoring, fixing bugs, and testing the software. These contributions are credited to:

- D.D. Billett, documentation, testing, enhancements
- E.C. Bland, DAWG Co-Chair (2019-), fit_speck_removal, documentation, testing
- A.G. Burrell, documentation, bugfixes, testing
- I. Coco, testing
- E.D.P. Cousins, CS10 and PSR10 convection models
- K. Kotyk, FITACF_v3
- P.V. Ponomarenko, DAWG Chair (2013-2019), FITACF_v2, FITACF_v3, data simulator library
- A.S. Reimer, refactorization, documentation, bugfixes
- A.J. Ribeiro, FITEX2, LMFIT, data simulator library
- M.T. Schmidt, refactorization, documentation, enhancements, bugfixes
- S.G. Shepherd, AACGM_v2, MLT_v2, IGRF_v2, elevation_v2, TS18 convection model
- K.T. Sterne, DAWG Co-Chair (2019-), code comments, documentation
- E.G. Thomas, TS18 convection model, IDL gridding library, sounding library, refactorization, modularization, code comments
- M.-T. Walach, bugfixes, testing, documentation
- C.L. Waters, FITACF_v2
