#  Hardware parameters for Blackstone radar.
#
# Each radar has a distinct set of hardware parameters that are used
# by the radar control software and the analysis software. These
# parameters are read in a distinct order and are assumed to have
# specific units. If either the order of the parameters or their units
# are incorrect, the processing and analysis software will produce
# incorrect answers that may not be easily identified. It is the
# responsibility of the SuperDARN P.I.s to insure that the hdw.dat files
# for their radars are correct and that these files are updated as
# required to accurately represent the physical state of the radar and
# that copies of these files are retained under revision control by Rob
# Barnes. Revision controlled versions of hdw.dat files are destributed
# with SuperDARN radar control software and with analysis software.
#
# The hardware parameters are distributed as a string of values
# delineated by one or more spaces. The following table specifies the
# parameters, their units, and a brief description of their meaning.
#
# 01) Station ID (unique numerical value). Assigned by Rob Barnes.
# 02) Last year that parameter string is valid. (4 digit year).
# 03) Last second of year that parameter string is valid (range 0 to
#     34163999 for non-leap years). The parameter string giving the current
#     configuration is assumed to be valid until the last second of 2999.
# 04) Geographic latitude of radar site (Given in decimal degrees to 3
#     decimal places. Southern hemisphere values are negative)
# 05) Geographic longitude of radar site (Given in decimal degrees to
#     3 decimal places. West longitude values are negative)
# 06) Altitude of the radar site (meters)
# 07) Scanning boresight (Direction of the center beam, measured in
#     degrees relative to geographic north. CCW rotations are negative.)
# 08) Beam separation (Angular separation in degrees between adjacent
#     beams. Normally 3.24 degrees)
# 09) Velocity sign (At the radar level, backscattered signals with
#     frequencies above the transmitted frequency are assigned positive
#     Doppler velocities while backscattered signals with frequencies below
#     the transmitted frequency are assigned negative Doppler velocity. This
#     convention can be reversed by changes in receiver design or in the
#     data samping rate. This parameter is set to +1 or -1 to maintain the
#     convention.)
#
# Some SuperDARN radars have analog receivers whereas others have
# analog front-end receivers followed by digital receivers. Analog
# receivers and analog front-ends can have gain and bandwidth controls
# that are identified here and corrected in the radar control software.
# Digital receiver information is retained and compensated for within
# the digital receiver driver.
#
# 10) Analog Rx attenuator step (dB)
#
# In order to obtain information on the vertical angle of arrival of
# the backscattered signals, the SuperDARN radars include a four antenna
# interferometer array in addition to the 16 antenna main array. This
# second array is typically displaced from the main array along the
# array normal direction and the different path length due to the
# displacement and the different cable lengths between the antenna
# arrays and their phasing matrices introduces a phase shift that is
# dependent on the elevation angle of the returning backscattered
# signal.
#
# 11) Tdiff (Propagation time from interferometer array antenna to
#     phasing matrix input minus propagation time from main array antenna
#     through transmitter to phasing matrix input. If the signal from the
#     interferometer comes first, then tdiff < 0. Units are in decimal
#     microseconds)
# 12) Phase sign (Cabling errors can lead to a 180 degree shift of the
#     interferometry phase measurement. +1 indicates that the sign is
#     correct, -1 indicates that it must be flipped.)
# 13) Interferometer offset  (Displacement of midpoint of
#     interferometer array from midpoint of main array. This is given in
#     meters in Cartesian coordinates. X is along the line of antennas with
#     +X toward higher antenna numbers, Y is along the array normal
#     direction with +Y in the direction of the array normal. Z is the
#     altitude difference, +Z up.)
#
# More analog receiver information
#
# 14) Analog Rx rise time (Time given in microseconds. Time delays of
#     less than ~10 microseconds can be ignored. If narrow-band filters are
#     used in analog receivers or front-ends, the time delays should be
#     specified.)
# 15) Analog attenuation stages (Number of stages. This is used for
#     gain control of an analog receiver or front-end.)
# 16) Maxinum of range gates used (Number of gates. This is used for
#     allocation of array storage.)
# 17) Maximum number of beams to be used at a particular radar site.
#     (Number of beams. It is important to specify the true  maximum. This
#     will assure that a given beam number always points in the same
#     direction. A subset of these beams, e.g. 8-23, can be used for
#     standard 16 beam operation.)
