# How to cite SuperDARN

The Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) consists of more than 30 radars operated by institutions in 10 different countries. The following review papers are recommended for general information about the network's scientific achievements, and for citing SuperDARN in publications:

During your study, if using data from individual radars only, please contact the Principal Investigator (PI) of that radar about potential co-authorship. 
A list of radars, institutions, and their PI's information can be found [here](http://vt.superdarn.org/tiki-index.php?page=Radar+Overview).  

## DOI
