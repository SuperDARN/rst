# Radar Software Toolkit (RST) 

RST is a collection  of data analysis, modelling and visualization tools originally developed for the SuperDARN project. It has evolved over the years into a robust, multi-platform software toolkit for working with a variety of ITM data sets including data from the Polar, TIMED and ACE spacecraft, ground based magnetometers, incoherrent scatter radars, and SuperDARN. The toolkit includes implementations of the Altitude-Adjusted Corrected Geomagnetic (AACGM) coordinate system, the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF), SGP4 and a set of coordinate transform functions. The toolkit is written using a combination of ANSI C and the Interactive Data Language (IDL) and has been tested on a variety of platforms.
