# GitHub Projects

[Projects on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards) are an easy way to organize task for a general or specific project/feature. 

## Getting Started 

Click on [New project](https://github.com/SuperDARN/rst/projects/new) to start with a new project. 
If you want to see other projects click on [RST projects](https://github.com/SuperDARN/rst/projects) for examples of the types of projects. 

When selecting a template is is recommended to use [Automated Kanban](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-automation-for-project-boards) as it will move tasks throughout the workflow. 

Once you create the project several columns will appear that can be edited or renamed; however, it is recommend to keep them as is for consistency. In the `To Do` column you can create cards that have tasks to do on this project these later can be turned into issues by clicking on the `...` three dots top right corner of the card and selecting `convert to issue`. Convert cards to issues when you are ready to work on the issue so the issue doesn't get stale. 

If an [issue](issues.md) and/or [pull request](pull_request.md) is made you can add the project on the right side column and will be placed in the one of the columns in the project. 

Other useful features of projects is [progress tracking](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/tracking-progress-on-your-project-board), as cards, issues, and pull requests are opened and closed/merged they will be moved alone the columns in the project which will show up in the progress bar. This is very helpful for specific project boards for features or have a set goal. 

## General Project

Some projects can be open ended for easy organization for users to focus their attention on things. Examples are:

- Bugs 
- Documentation 
- Best practices 

By assigning projects to issues and pull requests, users can organize issues and pull requests by that project. Thus it is helpful for others to assign projects so they can focus on them.

## Closing Projects 

Once a specific project is done, go to the [project page](https://github.com/SuperDARN/rst/projects) then select the `...` three dots to the right of the project and select `close`.
