/* This function returns the right ascension of the sun for a given
   Julian date.

   Calling sequence:
     ra = AstAlg_solar_right_ascension(double jd)

   The value is returned in DEGREES, not in the more traditional
   hours.  Convert to hour angle by dividing degrees by 15.

   The function calls the functions AstAlg_apparent_solar_longitude
   and AstAlg_apparent_obliquity
