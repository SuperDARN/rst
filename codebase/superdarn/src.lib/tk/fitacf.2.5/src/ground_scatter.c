/* 
   This version of the ground-scatter detection algorithm is based
   on a statistical analysis of ground-scatter vs ionospheric scatter
   done by Stefan Sundeen, Gerard Blanchard and Kile Baker.

   The analysis inluded all data from 12 days (with large amounts of both
   ionospheric scatter and ground scatter) distributed over all seasons of
   the year.  Two radars were used in the analysis, Saskatoon and Kapuskasing.

   The result of the initial statistical analysis showed that scatter was 
   most likely ground scatter if

           abs(v) < GS_VMAX - (GS_VMAX/GS_WMAX)*abs(width)

   Let g(vabs,wabs) = (abs(v) - GS_VMAX - (GS_VMAX/GS_WMAX)*abs(width))

   Then, if was assume the errors in v and width are independent,
   we can estimate the error in the function g to be:

   g_err/g = sqrt((v_err/vabs)^2 + (width_err/width)^2)

   Then the final condition for flagging data as ground scatter is:

   if g - g_err <= 0 then flag as ground scatter.
