Radar Software Toolkit
========

In addition to this code, you will need the following packages:

Debian 8.7 | Mint 18.1 | OpenSUSE 42.2 | Ubuntu 16.04 | macOS 10.12.4
---------- | --------- | ------------- | ------------ | --------------
gcc | libc6-dev | gcc | libhdf5-serial-dev | libhdf5
libhdf5-serial-dev | libncurses5-dev | hdf5-devel | libncurses-dev | libnetcdf
libnetcdf-dev | libnetcdf-dev | libpng16-devel | libnetcdf-dev | libcurses
libncurses | libpng16-dev | libX11-devel | libpng12-dev | libpng16
libpng12-dev | libx11-dev | libXext6 | libx11-dev | libx11
libx11-dev | libxext-dev | libXext-devel | libxext-dev | cdf
libxext-dev | | netcdf | netpbm | netpbm (10.77.03_2+x11)
netpbm | | netcdf-devel | |
 | | | ncurses-devel | |
 | | | zlib-devel | |

You will also need the CDF (Common Data Format) library which can be downloaded from NASA.
You can find the latest release at: http://cdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/  
For macOS it is also available through macports, as are all listed dependencies  
For Opensuse you will need to make a symlink lcurses library to libncuses (recommended) or modify the CDF Makefile. 
* (Recommended) To make a symlink from lncurses library to lcurses; run the following commands in the terminal:

        ln -s /usr/lib64/libncurses.so /usr/lib64/libcurses.so
        ln -s /usr/lib64/libncurses.a /usr/lib64/libcurses.a

* To modify the Makefile change the following:  
`CURSESLIB_linux_gnu=-lcurses` to `CURSESLIB_linux_gnu=-lncurses`  
`CURSESLIB_linux_gnu32=-lcurses` to `CURSESLIB_linux_gnu32=-lncurses`  
`CURSESLIB_linux_gnu64=-lcurses` to `CURSESLIB_linux_gnu64=-lncurses`  

## Install notes:


1. Upon obtaining the software (with git clone or downloading a zip file), make sure the RST
   environment variables are properly set.   In `rst/.profile.bash`:

       OSTYPE="linux" for any linux operating system or "darwin" for macOS
       SYSTEM="linux" or "darwin" as appropriate

   In `rst/.profile/base.bash`, check to make sure these paths are appropriate:

   `XPATH, NETCDF_PATH, CDF_PATH`

   If you are running macOS and run into issues with the X11 libraries, you may
   need to add a symbolic link.

   If you have IDL, check to see that `IDL_IPATH` in `rst/.profile/idl.bash` is correct.
   (Note: for users without access to IDL, modifying the `IDL_IPATH` environment variable is
   not required).

2. Load the RST environment variables.  For example, this is accomplished in linux by modifying
   the `~/.bashrc` file by adding:

        # bash profile for rst
        export RSTPATH="INSTALL LOCATION"/rst
        . $RSTPATH/.profile.bash

   where the INSTALL LOCATION is the path with the RST repository that has been copied to your
   computer.  In order to load the environment variables you just setup, you'll need to close 
   your current terminal and open a new terminal, or from the command line type:
   
       source ~/.bashrc

3. Run `make.build` from the command line.  You may need to change directory to `$RSTPATH/build/script`.
   This runs a helper script that sets up other compiling code.

   If you are running macOS Sierra or later, you may have trouble for this step
   and step 4 if you run the commands in iTerm.app, due to a non-standard bash
   implimentation.  These can be avoided by running the installation in a
   xterm terminal like XQuartz.

4. In the same directory run `make.code` to compile all of the code.
   This runs a script to find all of the source codes and compile them into binaries.
   A log of this compilation is stored in `$RSTPATH/log`.

   4a.	 If you don't have IDL and the IDL skip in make.code fails, you will see an error
   	 upon the inability to locate `idl_export.h`.  If this happens:

	 ```
	 cd $RSTPATH/codebase/superdarn/src.lib/tk
	 tar -P -czvf idl.tar.gz idl
	 rm -rf idl
	 cd $RSTPATH/build/script
	 make.code
	 ```

   4b.	 If the order of make.code is executed incorrectly, you will see an error upon
   	 the inability to locate a header file (i.e. `sza.h`).  If this happens (using
	 `sza.h` as an example):

	 ```
	 find $RSTPATH -name "sza.h"
	 >> $RSTPATH/codebase/imagery/src.lib/sza.1.9/include/sza.h
	 cd $RSTPATH/codebase/imagery/src.lib/sza.1.9/src
	 make clean
	 make
	 cd $RSTPATH/build/script
	 make.code
	 ```

5. To compile the html documentation, run `make.doc` from the command line.
