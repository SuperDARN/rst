<description><p>The <fn href="FitCnxRead.html">FitCnxRead</fn> function reads fitted ACF data from a remote server.</p>
<p>The argument <ar>sock</ar> is a pointer to an array of file descriptors associated with a set of connections. The argument <ar>num</ar> is the number of elements in the array.</p>
<p> When a block of data is received from one of the connections it is decoded
and used to populate the appropriate members of the array of radar parameter blocks pointed to by the argument <ar>prm</ar> and the array of <code>fit</code> data structures pointed to by the argument <ar>fit</ar>.</p>  
<p>The argument <ar>flag</ar> is a pointer to an array used to record whether a message read from a particular connection was successfully decoded. If no message was received for a connection, then the corresponding element of the array is set to zero. If a message was successfully decoded, the element is set to (1), and if an error occurred it is set to (-1).</p>
<p>The argument <ar>tout</ar> is a pointer that defines a time limit for the function. If no messages are received within the specified time, the function will return. If tout is a <code>NULL</code> pointer the function will wait indefinitely for a message to be received.</p>
</description>
<returns>Returns zero on success. On error, (-1) is returned.</returns>
<errors>On error, (-1) is returned.</errors>
